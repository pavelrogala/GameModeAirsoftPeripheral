# My PlatformIO Project

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of PlatformIO for embedded development. It includes essential directories for organizing code, libraries, and header files.

## Project Structure

- `include/`: Contains header files for the project.
- `lib/`: Contains libraries that can be used in the project.
- `src/`: Contains the main source code files.
- `platformio.ini`: Configuration file for PlatformIO.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE that supports PlatformIO.
3. Install the necessary dependencies as specified in `platformio.ini`.
4. Build and upload the project to your target board.

## Usage

After uploading the code to your board, the project will execute the main functionality defined in `src/main.cpp`. Modify the source code as needed to fit your application requirements.
